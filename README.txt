Tips to follow the PowerPoint

- Read the PowerPoint. Tempting to just copy code, but saves so much time and effort if you just follow the code. 
- First PowerPoint has the completed code in the last slide. When they get to a point where the code you've written is correct, but nothing runs, check these and find the section that actually runs the code in the World file. It doesn't tell you to include it. 
- The OOP structure at the start of each PowerPoint is a golden ticket to understanding. It shows exactly where every function you write is meant to go. It sometimes isn't clear.
- PowerPoint two, you need to put  the snake_body array in the Snake class, under __innit__ function. 
- penup() is a turtle command meaning lift the pen up, i.e. when the turtle moves it won't draw behind it. Removing this line of code will leave a line behind anything when it moves.
